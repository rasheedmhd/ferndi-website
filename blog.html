            <div>
                Without an Easy and clear way to see how much you spend on Subscriptions, subscriptions can be a sink hole that drains too much of your money that you think it were. See your total money spent on Subscriptions so you that you can make informed decisions.

                Finally I am releasing my wealth management app to the general public. 
            
                What is Ferndi?
                It is a cross platform app to managing your wealth. At the moment it is only available on Android.
                
                Why do I need Ferndi?</div>

            <h1 class="my-6 text-3xl font-bold"> Spend Tracking </h1>

            <p> With Ferndi, you can track every expense that you make in real time. The feature for tracking your expense helps you Categorize your Spends and wallets that you Spend from.</p>

    <section class="text-white grid md:grid-cols-3 sm:my-6 p-4 sm:gap-10 gap-6 ">

            </div>

            <h1 class="my-6 text-3xl font-bold"> Categorization </h1>

            <p>    Okay, Last month how much did you spend on Food? how about mobile data or credit? Transportation ? How much did you dash out to your significant other? How much did you spend on Charity?
                With Ferndi's Spend Categorization, We help you answer all these questions and more. </p>
            <p>
                The hope is to make you take a look at your Spends and ask yourself, if I hadn't attended that Sports game, I could have saved 100GHS, When you start asking these questions, you will take your financial health more serious and Ferndi want's to spearhead that change.

            <h1 class="my-6 text-3xl font-bold"> Subscriptions </h1>

            <p> I love music and as I type this, I have a Subscription to Apple Music Family Plan, Youtube Premium ( Comes with Youtube Music )  and Spotify Family Plan.</p>
    
            <p>How much will that cost me a month? How about in 6 months, okay a Year? Ferndi helps me with that, giving me a clean UI presenting my Subscriptions base on durations that I pay (A month, a year and one time purchases )

            </div>

            <h1 class="my-6 text-3xl font-bold"> Charge </h1>
            <p>Ferndi doesn't only give you the ability to track your Subscriptions but it gives you a feature called Charge, With Charge, you record your Subscriptions payments by the tap of a single button, easy peasy.</p>
            
            <p>As a plus you can even use Subscriptions to track your recurring Spends, Record once and effect  and record payment on the Charge day. </p>
            <p>
                The hope is to make you take a look at your Spends and ask yourself, if I hadn't attended that Sports game, I could have saved 100GHS, When you start asking these questions, you will take your financial health more serious and Ferndi want's to spearhead that change.

        <div class="bg-cardGreen p-6 rounded-3xl">
            <div class="w-10 h-10 font-bold rounded-full bg-white text-ctaGrey flex justify-center items-center">
                <p>4</p>
            </div>

            <h1 class="my-6 text-3xl font-bold" id="wallets"> Wallets </h1>

            <p>   This is one thing that makes Ferndi really unique compared to other apps for wealth management.
                Wallets are at the core of Ferndi. To record a Spend, you must first create a Wallet and it is mandatory that there exist money* in the Wallet you are Spending from. Other apps allow you to record Spends from Wallets even if you have no money* in them. Ferndi doesn't allow that. In the real world you can't Spend from your wallet if you have no money inside. Ferndi goes against the status quo by trying to mimic real life. In fact this is why I call Ferndi An opinionated way to manage your wealth.
